# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Allowing tasks and discussions to remain informal without proper documentation on the project board.
- Spending extra time revisiting issues that could have been avoided with more structured processes in place.
- Depending only on debugging tools instead of thoroughly analyzing errors.

## Continue Doing

- Great communication in the WhatsApp channel.
- Very productive group and one-to-one Google meetings.
- Continue conducting helpful and understandable code reviews.
- Maintaining a positive and supportive environment among team members.
- Providing enough time for review.

## Start Doing

- Clarifying and unifying the project board workflow.
- Encourage active participation from all members in discussions and tasks.
- Scheduling periodic reviews to ensure alignment with project goals.
- Understanding rebasing and other methods to solve merge conflicts.

## Lessons Learned

- Effective group communication is an essential key to success.
- Clearly defined roles and responsibilities improve accountability.
- Regular feedback loops help identify and address issues early.

## Strategy vs. Board

- Group meetings were never reflected on the project board.
- Reflect group documentation efforts on the project board.

## What parts of your plan went as expected?

- The majority of meetings and discussions were productive and aligned with project goals.
- Clear communication channels, such as WhatsApp and Google Meetings, worked well for collaboration.
- Code reviews were effective in improving the quality of the work.

## What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Unfortunately, not all the group members were active, which made the code review part and other collaboration work more challenging.
- We havenâ€™t put any of our collaboration documents as issues on the project board (except this one).

## Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

Yes, as a group with no previous experience using GitHub, we identified several areas that could have improved our strategy:

- Establishing clear regulations for naming files, branches, and pull requests to maintain consistency and organization.
- Providing instructions on resolving merge conflicts effectively.

These additions would have been invaluable in setting a solid foundation for our project and minimizing confusion.
