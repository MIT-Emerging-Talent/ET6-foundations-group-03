# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Allowing tasks and discussions to remain informal without proper documentation on the project board.
- Spending extra time revisiting issues that could have been avoided with more structured processes in place.
- Depending only on debugging tools instead of thoroughly analyzing errors.
- Skipping regular progress updates and review sessions, making it harder to identify and address issues early.

## Continue Doing

- Great communication in the WhatsApp channel.
- Very productive group and one-to-one Google meetings.
- Continue conducting helpful and understandable code reviews.
- Keep the practice of discussing the challenges among group members before Q&A sessions.
- Maintaining a positive and supportive environment among team members.
- Providing enough time for review.
- Practicing flexibility in all matters, and being willing to review even at the last minute.
- Continue supporting and helping one another.
- Actively seeking feedback from peers and implementing it constructively to improve the quality of work.
- Ensuring that knowledge and resources are shared effectively within the group, minimizing knowledge gaps.
- Celebrating team achievements, big or small, to foster morale and motivation.
- Ensuring that knowledge and resources are shared effectively within the group, minimizing knowledge gaps.

## Start Doing

- Clarifying and unifying the project board workflow.
- Encourage active participation from all members in discussions and tasks.
- Scheduling periodic reviews to ensure alignment with project goals.
- Understanding rebasing and other methods to solve merge conflicts.

## Lessons Learned

- Effective group communication is an essential key to success.
- Clearly defined roles and responsibilities improve accountability.
- Regular feedback loops help identify and address issues early.
- Practice holding group meetings to collaboratively solve issues, such as working together to understand complex concepts like rebasing. This approach
encourages shared learning, strengthens teamwork,
and ensures everyone is on the same page.
- Use these sessions to break down challenges step-by-step, allowing all members to contribute ideas and build confidence in tackling similar problems
independently in the future.
- Striving to complete assignments ahead of deadlines to allow time for reviews, feedback, and any necessary revisions.
- Ensuring a backup copy of the code is always maintained, using version control tools like Git to avoid data loss and track changes systematically.

## Strategy vs. Board

- Group meetings were never reflected on the project board.
- Reflect group documentation efforts on the project board.

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- The majority of meetings and discussions were productive and aligned with project goals.
- Clear communication channels, such as WhatsApp and Google Meetings, worked well for collaboration.
- Code reviews were effective in improving the quality of the work.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Unfortunately, not all the group members were active, which made the code review part and other collaboration work more challenging.
- We havenâ€™t put any of our collaboration documents as issues on the project board (except this one).

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

Yes, as a group with no previous experience using GitHub, we identified several areas that could have improved our strategy:

- Establishing clear regulations for naming files, branches, and pull requests to maintain consistency and organization.
- Providing instructions on resolving merge conflicts effectively.

These additions would have been invaluable in setting a solid foundation for our project and minimizing confusion.
