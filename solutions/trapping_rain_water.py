def trap(height):

    Calculates the amount of rainwater that can be trapped given an elevation map.

    Parameters:
        height (list[int]): A list of non-negative integers representing the elevation map, where the width of each bar is 1.
    Returns:
        int: The total amount of trapped rainwater.

    Logic:
        - Uses two pointers (left and right) to traverse the elevation map.
        - Tracks the maximum height to the left and right of each bar.
        - Accumulates water trapped based on the minimum of these maximum heights.
